# Image_File_Encoder

### Introduction
I had a Crazy idea... and this became of it... for literally no reason other than asking can it be done. It dosnt make the file smaller, in fact, it makes it a little bigger in size. However, it encodes the stick image using a binary table to match the colors in the provided file, I wanted to see if i could find a unique way to share "Public Domain Videos" as a non-parsable image (yes, I now have no idea why i made this either). 

### How my local LLM describes the tool
Image_File_Encoder is a quirky encoding and decoding tool that transforms binary data into colourful images and back again. With Image_File_Encoder, you can encode any file into a unique image, making your data not only secure but also visually appealing. This project is perfect for those who want to experiment with data encryption while adding a splash of creativity.

### Features
- Encrypt any file into an image using a custom binary-to-color mapping.
- Decrypt an image to retrieve the original file data.
- Visualize your data in a colorful and artistic way.
- A fun and educational project for tinkering with binary encoding and decoding.

### How to Use Image_File_Encoder
1. **Clone the Repository:** Begin by cloning the Image_File_Encoder repository to your local machine.
2. **Encryption:**
   - Prepare the file you want to encrypt and replace `"your_input_file.txt"` in the encryption script with its path.
   - Run the encryption script to generate an output image containing your encrypted data.
3. **Decryption:**
   - Replace `"output_image.png"` in the decryption script with the path to the image generated in the encryption step.
   - Run the decryption script to retrieve the original file.
4. **Enjoy:** You now have a colorful and secure way to store and retrieve your data!

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Python Imaging Library (PIL)

### Disclaimer
Image_File_Encoder is a fun and experimental project. While it can be used for data encryption, it should not be considered a secure encryption method for sensitive data. It is intended for educational and creative purposes.
